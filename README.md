# Kickstarer Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose 
    The purpose of this analysis is to provide information on the launch of different theater campaigns specifically in relation to plays. This includes their subsequent success or failure based on producion goals and timing. This information may be utilized in the future by those looking to launch a successful campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    Theater productions were more successful when launched in May and June. Campaigns launched in November and December did not do as well, with december having a near equal number of successes and failures.
    
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
   Goal amounts below $15,000 resulted in more success, but the higher the value the less the success until $15,000. The most successes were achieved between the range $35,000 and $44,999, any other goal value not mentioned resulted in more failures.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered 
    It was challenging correcting the minor errors made as they were harder to spot, for example the blanks in my pivot table took a second to correct. Typing out the COUNTIFS was very time consuming so it was difficult to do it all without an error. The more data points there are to analye the more difficult it becomes to prevent errors.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
    Looking at this data set one can conclude that the most optimal time to release a play is between the months of May and June with May being the best time. One should not release a play around the months of November and December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? 
    According to this data for a successful play campaign the goal should be between $35,000 and $44,999.
    
    

- What are some limitations of this dataset? 
    The sample sizes from the different countries is not neccessarily even so it becomes difficult to determe important conclusions for campaigns in those countries with the smaller sample sizes. The outcome cannot measure artistic success very easily, aside from staff pick and spotlight. So whether or not that influenced the campaigns success cannot be quantified, which can cause changes in the information.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? A graph comparing location of campaign with its success; one that displays outcome and the number of backers; and maaybe staff pick, spotlight and outcome.
